He had a love-hate relationship with Bavaria which showed itself in his work. Some of his controversial films, such as Das Gespenst (The Ghost), were presented at the Berlinale festival.. Born Herbert Schild in 1938 in Munich,[2] Achternbusch was the illegitimate son of the sports teacher Luise Schild, n\u00e9e Muckenthaler, and the dental technician Adolf Achternbusch.[3] He grew up in the Bavarian Forest with his grandmother.[3][4] In 1960, he was adopted by his biological father and took the name Achternbusch.[5] After his Abitur in Cham,[6] he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Nuremberg, and at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.[4][7]. In the early 1970s, Achternbusch wrote the prose Die Alexanderschlacht,[4] an important novel for the literary avant-garde of the time.[8] Achternbusch produced almost 30 low budget films.[9] He was often leading actor in his own films,[10] and worked together mainly with friends.[11] In 1975, Achternbusch met actor Josef Bierbichler, who played in 15 of his films, partly without salary.[12] Also notable were the actresses Annamirl Bierbichler\u00a0[de] and Margarethe von Trotta,[13] as well as actor and painter Heinz Braun and cinematographer J\u00f6rg Schmidt-Reitwein.[14] In 1974, he made his film debut with Das Andechser Gef\u00fchl.[15] The 1977 film Bierkampf\u00a0[de] (Beerfight) caused attention with numerous drunk Oktoberfest visitors as involuntary amateur actors.[4] Role models are the comedians Karl Valentin and Groucho Marx.[16][17][18] His anarchist surrealistic films are not known to a wide audience in Germany, although one of them, Das Gespenst (The Ghost), caused a scandal in 1983 because of its alleged blasphemous contents,[19] including a scene where Christ climbs down from the cross and later goes bathing with a nun.[15] Federal Minister of the Interior Friedrich Zimmermann halted the funding for the film as it was deemed to have violated the \"religious feeling of large parts of the population\".[4] For a long time, no public broadcaster showed any of Achternbusch's films.[20] Years of legal battle ensued, with Achternbusch finally winning in 1992.[11] In the 1983 film Der Depp, he had his favorite enemy Franz Josef Strauss poisoned.[6].\nThought 2:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Herbert Achternbusch was indeed involved in filmmaking as a German film director and writer.

The airport opened in 1951 and took over existing scheduled airline traffic to Fairbanks, which had previously used Ladd Army Airfield.[5] Alaska Airlines used Fairbanks as its main hub in the 1950s, with service to Seattle and Portland as well as intrastate service to Anchorage, Nome and other destinations.[6] By 1967, however, the airline shifted its Alaska hub to Anchorage; its Anchorage-Fairbanks service continues to this day.[7] In the mid-1970s, following the development of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, Alaska Airlines and Braniff International offered \"interchange service\" between Fairbanks and Houston via Anchorage, Seattle and Dallas.[8] In 1982, following airline deregulation, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines began a similar interchange service using Boeing 727s.[9]. Pan American World Airways had also served Fairbanks since 1932. The station was originally opened after the acquisition of Pacific International Airways and used for short-haul services to Juneau, Seattle, Ketchikan, Whitehorse and other destinations.[10] Pan Am intended to use Fairbanks as a stop for service to Asia as early as 1931, but initial difficulty in negotiating landing rights with the Soviet Union, followed by the outbreak of World War II, delayed these plans until decades later.
