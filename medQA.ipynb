In many cases it may result in reduced or limited vision.[3]. In normal eyesight, while the head rotates about an axis, distant visual images are sustained by rotating eyes in the opposite direction of the respective axis.[4] The semicircular canals in the vestibule of the ear sense angular acceleration, and send signals to the nuclei for eye movement in the brain. From here, a signal is relayed to the extraocular muscles to allow one's gaze to fix on an object as the head moves. Nystagmus occurs when the semicircular canals are stimulated (e.g., by means of the caloric test, or by disease) while the head is stationary.\n","\n","Thought 2: The patient has nystagmus while the head is stationary, so it is not caused by the semicircular canals being stimulated.

However, only about 1% of the electrical current crosses the bony skull into the brain because skull impedance is about 100 times higher than skin impedance.[2]. Aside from effects on the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia.[3]: 259  Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and transient memory loss.[4][5] Among treatments for severely depressed pregnant women, ECT is one of the least harmful to the fetus.[6]. ECT is often used as an intervention for major depressive disorder, mania, and catatonia.[4] The usual course of ECT involves multiple administrations, typically given two or three times per week until the patient no longer has symptoms. ECT is administered under anesthesia with a muscle relaxant.[7] ECT can differ in its application in three ways: electrode placement, treatment frequency, and the electrical waveform of the stimulus.\n","\n","Thought 2: The complications of ECT include confusion and transient memory loss.

It appears to occur more commonly in females and the elderly.[4] Furthermore, certain occupational groups, such as teachers and singers, are at an increased risk.[5][6]. Long-term hoarseness, or hoarseness that persists over three weeks, especially when not associated with a cold or flu should be assessed by a medical doctor.[2] It is also recommended to see a doctor if hoarseness is associated with coughing up blood, difficulties swallowing, a lump in the neck, pain when speaking or swallowing, difficulty breathing, or complete loss of voice for more than a few days.[2] For voice to be classified as \"dysphonic\", abnormalities must be present in one or more vocal parameters: pitch, loudness, quality, or variability.[7] Perceptually, dysphonia can be characterised by hoarse, breathy, harsh, or rough vocal qualities, but some kind of phonation remains.[7]. Dysphonia can be categorized into two broad main types: organic and functional, and classification is based on the underlying pathology. While the causes of dysphonia can be divided into five basic categories, all of them result in an interruption of the ability of the vocal folds to vibrate normally during exhalation, which affects the voice.\n","\n","Thought 2: The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol, so the cause is unlikely to be related to those factors.

Regular monthly vaginal bleeding during the reproductive years, menstruation, is a normal physiologic process. During the reproductive years, bleeding that is excessively heavy (menorrhagia or heavy menstrual bleeding), occurs between monthly menstrual periods (intermenstrual bleeding), occurs more frequently than every 21 days (abnormal uterine bleeding), occurs too infrequently (oligomenorrhea), or occurs after vaginal intercourse (postcoital bleeding) should be evaluated.[2][3]. The causes of abnormal vaginal bleeding vary by age,[4] and such bleeding can be a sign of specific medical conditions ranging from hormone imbalances or anovulation to malignancy (cervical cancer, vaginal cancer or uterine cancer).[2]  In young children, or elderly adults with cognitive impairment, the source of bleeding may not be obvious, and may be from the urinary tract (hematuria) or the rectum rather than the vagina, although most adult women can identify the site of bleeding.[5] When vaginal bleeding occurs in prepubertal children or in postmenopausal women, it always needs medical attention.[6][7][5].\n","\n","Thought 2: The woman is pregnant, so the bleeding may be related to her pregnancy.

Risk factors include trauma, including putting the finger in the nose, blood thinners, high blood pressure, alcoholism, seasonal allergies, dry weather, and inhaled corticosteroids.[3] There are two types: anterior, which is more common; and posterior, which is less common but more serious.[3] Anterior nosebleeds generally occur from Kiesselbach's plexus while posterior bleeds generally occur from the sphenopalatine artery or Woodruff's plexus.[3] The diagnosis is by direct observation.[1]. Prevention may include the use of petroleum jelly in the nose.[4] Initially, treatment is generally the application of pressure for at least five minutes over the lower half of the nose.[5] If this is not sufficient, nasal packing may be used.[5] Tranexamic acid may also be helpful.[6] If bleeding episodes continue, endoscopy is recommended.[5]. About 60% of people have a nosebleed at some point in their life.[7] About 10% of nosebleeds are serious.[7] Nosebleeds are rarely fatal, accounting for only 4 of the 2.4 million deaths in the U.S. in 1999.[11] Nosebleeds most commonly affect those younger than 10 and older than 50.[2].\n","\n","Thought 4: The woman's hemoglobin concentration is low, so I need to find out what could cause this.\n","Action 4: Search[hemoglobin concentration]\n","Observation 4: Could not find hemoglobin concentration.

Platelets are found only in mammals, whereas in other vertebrates (e.g. birds, amphibians), thrombocytes circulate as intact mononuclear cells.[4]: 3.
