According to the film's website, \"Marx Reloaded \u2026 examines the relevance of German socialist philosopher Karl Marx's ideas for understanding the global economic and financial crisis of 2008\u201309.\" The film also considers, in the context of an alleged revival of Marxist thinking, whether \"communism might provide the solution to the growing economic and environmental challenges facing the planet\".[7]. In an interview with Verso Books, writer-director Jason Barker described his intention in making the film \"to reload or reimagine Marx as a thinker, without the usual totalitarian moralising.\" Barker criticised the \"clich\u00e9\" according to which \"Marx's diagnoses of capitalism are validated whereas his 'prescription' of communism is rubbished on the grounds that it's 'utopian'.\" Asked whether the renewed popularity of Marx is evidence of a return of communism as a political force, or \"just the spectre of Marx haunting the academies\", Barker replied that \"political thinking today is again converging on precisely the type of social conditions in which Marx lived.\"[8]. In a separate interview, Barker also discussed the film's use of animation, in particular his decision to parody The Matrix, admitting that although it was an \"obvious parody\" and \"fun to make\", there was also a philosophical dimension to the animation scenes in which Marx meets Leon Trotsky and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek.[9].", "Bitter Jester is a documentary film starring Maija DiGiorgio, Kenny Simmons, Jody Del Giorno, and Heather McConnell.

From 1821 he worked as a stage composer and conductor at the municipal theatres in Dresden (from 1821), Leipzig (from 1827), and the Court Theatre at Hanover (from 1830), where the opera Hans Heiling (1833) established his name among the leading German opera composers of the time.[3] He died in Hanover..", "Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst von Weber (c.\u200918 November 1786\u00a0\u2013 5 June 1826) was a German composer, conductor, virtuoso pianist, guitarist, and critic of the early Romantic period.
