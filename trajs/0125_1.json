It was an Auto Trail that ran from the Atlantic Ocean in Plymouth, Massachusetts, through Montana to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, to the Pacific Ocean in Seattle, Washington.[citation needed] The road slogan was \"A Good Road from Plymouth Rock to Puget Sound\".[citation needed]. The Yellowstone Trail was conceived by Joseph William Parmley of Ipswich, South Dakota. In April 1912, the first step he and his local influential colleagues wanted was a 25-mile-long (40\u00a0km) good road from Ipswich over to Aberdeen, also in South Dakota. By May, the intent had expanded to get a transcontinental route built, including to the popular tourist destination to the west, Yellowstone National Park.[2][3].", "Invalid action: search[competition between", "Invalid action: finish", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "thoughts": ["I need to search for the trail that is about 3000 miles long and was established in 1912.
